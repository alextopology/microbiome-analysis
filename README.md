# microbiome-analysis
This repository encompasses synthetic datasets, including stool, biopsy, and saliva samples from adenomatous polyps (AP) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. These datasets were utilized for XGBoost classification and SHAP analysis. The taxon information extracted from the original OTU table, as well as that aligned with our referenced article, is provided. Additionally, all Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) files containing the analysis scripts are included.
